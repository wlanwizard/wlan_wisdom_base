## SUMMARY

West Pvis discusses Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) for 6 GHz wireless networks, explaining device classifications, regulatory approvals, and the necessity of AFC for protecting incumbents in the frequency band. He also touches on the challenges and potential benefits of AFC for Wi-Fi engineers and indoor vs. outdoor APs.

## IDEAS:

- AFC is crucial for managing the 6 GHz frequency band to prevent interference with incumbent users.
- There are different device classifications within the 6 GHz band, including low power indoor and standard power modes.
- Regulatory approval for standard power mode in the US and Canada is pending, with expectations of imminent approval.
- Standard power mode allows devices to use higher transmit power compared to low power mode.
- The AFC system is designed to protect incumbents by restricting certain channels or requiring reduced transmit power in specific areas.
- Automated Frequency Control (AFC) is necessary due to the 6 GHz band being previously licensed and now partially unlicensed.
- Indoor signal propagation at 6 GHz is considered not to interfere with incumbents, but outdoor usage poses significant concerns.
- The AFC system involves an access point checking in with a frequency coordination service to ensure safe operation without interfering with incumbents.
- Access points need to provide geolocation, height above ground level, and unique device identifiers to the AFC system daily.
- The introduction of AFC may have a learning curve for Wi-Fi engineers due to its complexity and requirements.
- AFC could enable higher transmit power for clients, potentially improving network performance.
- The process of AFC involves sending a spectrum request with detailed information about the access point's location, operating classes, and desired frequencies.
- Outdoor APs and those using external antennas are particularly affected by AFC requirements.
- The impact of AFC on indoor APs and whether it's beneficial remains uncertain.

## QUOTES:

- "AFC is simple; it's to protect the incumbents."
- "Standard power allows devices to use higher transmit power."
- "We haven't seen AFC approved yet because the incumbents are pushing back."
- "The whole point of the AFC system is to safely use 6 GHz to protect the incumbents."
- "AFC was not designed by people that actually deploy anything."
- "If you're an outdoor AP, yes, you absolutely care about AFC."
- "Indoor is the real question; do we care about AFC for indoor?"
- "The client transmit limitations of low power indoor mode could be overcome using standard power."
- "AFC will have a little bit of a learning curve."
- "Most people will not be able to connect to it."

## HABITS:

- Regularly checking regulatory updates for standard power mode approvals.
- Monitoring device classifications and their implications on network design.
- Engaging with frequency coordination services for AFC compliance.
- Providing accurate geolocation and device information for AFC requests.
- Re-evaluating network setups in light of new AFC regulations.
- Staying informed about incumbent users in the 6 GHz band to avoid interference.
- Experimenting with different transmit powers to assess network performance.
- Keeping up-to-date with industry discussions on AFC's impact and best practices.
- Attending technical sessions and workshops on AFC and 6 GHz band usage.
- Collaborating with vendors and other Wi-Fi engineers to navigate AFC challenges.

## FACTS:

- The 6 GHz band was previously licensed but has been made partially unlicensed.
- Low power indoor devices operate at reduced transmit power compared to standard power devices.
- Regulatory approval for standard power mode in the US and Canada is pending but expected soon.
- AFC is designed to protect incumbents in the 6 GHz band from interference by new unlicensed users.
- Access points must check in daily with an AFC service to ensure they are not interfering with incumbent users.
- The AFC system requires detailed information from access points, including geolocation and device identifiers.
- Outdoor APs and those using external antennas must comply with AFC requirements to operate in the 6 GHz band.
- The impact of AFC on indoor APs and network performance is still under evaluation.

- Outdoor AP deployments should prioritize compliance with AFC to avoid regulatory issues.
- Consider the potential benefits of standard power mode for improving network performance.
- Stay informed about regulatory developments regarding standard power mode approvals.
- Collaborate with vendors to ensure access points are equipped for AFC compliance.
- Experiment with different network setups to understand the impact of transmit power limitations.
- Attend industry events and sessions focused on 6 GHz band usage and AFC challenges.
- Engage in discussions with other professionals about best practices for navigating AFC requirements.
