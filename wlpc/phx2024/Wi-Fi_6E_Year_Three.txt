## SUMMARY

West Peris, a self-proclaimed Wi-Fi addict, presents at the WiFi 6E year three conference, focusing on the deployment, challenges, and insights of 6 GHz Wi-Fi. He emphasizes the real-world impact and learning curve associated with WiFi 6E, contrasting it with the potential but yet-to-be-realized benefits of WiFi 7.

## IDEAS:

- WiFi 6E operates in the 6 GHz band, offering significantly more non-overlapping channels compared to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- The deployment of WiFi 6E is still evolving, with ongoing learning about best practices for its implementation.
- Device classification (low power indoor, standard power, very low power) plays a crucial role in the deployment and functionality of WiFi 6E.
- The regulatory environment significantly influences the deployment strategies and capabilities of WiFi 6E devices.
- Client transmit power limitations are a critical consideration in WiFi 6E deployments, affecting coverage and performance.
- The design considerations for WiFi 6E are similar to those for 5 GHz in free space but differ when materials that attenuate signals more at higher frequencies are involved.
- The choice of channel bandwidths in WiFi 6E can impact both network performance and client device behavior.
- Security protocols for WiFi 6E are more stringent, requiring WPA3 or higher for operation.
- Roaming behaviors and mechanisms like the Reduced Neighbor Report (RNR) are essential for optimizing WiFi 6E performance.
- The adoption of WiFi 6E presents an opportunity to reevaluate and potentially redesign network SSIDs and deployment strategies.
- Transitioning to WPA3 ahead of full WiFi 6E deployment can prepare networks for future security requirements.
- Power requirements for WiFi 6E access points may necessitate infrastructure upgrades.

## QUOTES:

- "I want to talk about something that's real and something that's here."
- "We still have a lot to learn and master about Wi-Fi 60 6 GHz."
- "The industry doesn't have all the answers on the best way to deploy 6 GHz Wi-Fi."
- "Everything we've deployed today is low power indoor."
- "The client transmit power is fairly restrictive and is often a limiting factor in six gz deployments."
- "80 is the new 40, and 40 is the new 20 in 6 gig."
- "You can only do WPA3 or higher for operation in 6 GHz."
- "The Reduced Neighbor Report (RNR) is by far the most important discovery mechanism for 6 gigahertz."
- "Even if you're not ready to deploy six gig, go enable WPA3."
- "We have the best opportunity now with 6 gig to actually exceed a gig."

## HABITS:

- Regularly reviewing and updating knowledge on Wi-Fi technologies and regulations.
- Prioritizing real-world impact and current technologies over emerging but unproven ones.
- Engaging with the community through conferences to share and gain insights on Wi-Fi deployment.
- Conducting thorough testing and experimentation with different Wi-Fi configurations and settings.
- Keeping abreast of regulatory changes and adapting deployment strategies accordingly.
- Emphasizing security in network design by adopting the latest protocols early.
- Considering client device capabilities and limitations in network design decisions.
- Utilizing advanced roaming mechanisms like RNR to enhance network performance.
- Reevaluating network designs and SSID strategies in light of new technology capabilities.
- Preparing network infrastructure for future requirements, such as power needs for newer access points.

## FACTS:

- WiFi 6E offers up to 59 non-overlapping channels in the US, significantly more than the available channels in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- Low power indoor devices are currently the primary type deployed for WiFi 6E.
- The US has stricter regulations regarding external antennas and power modes compared to other regions.
- Client transmit power limitations can significantly affect WiFi 6E network performance, especially at the edge of coverage areas.
- Material attenuation varies between 5 GHz and 6 GHz, impacting design considerations.
- Wider channel bandwidths in WiFi 6E can allow for higher peak transmit powers from client devices.
- Security requirements for WiFi 6E operation are stricter, necessitating WPA3 or higher protocols.
- The Reduced Neighbor Report (RNR) plays a crucial role in client device discovery in WiFi 6E networks.
- Adoption rates of WPA3 have been increasing, with significant growth observed over recent years at large public events.
- Power requirements for WiFi 6E access points may necessitate infrastructure upgrades, including support for PoE++ (BT).
