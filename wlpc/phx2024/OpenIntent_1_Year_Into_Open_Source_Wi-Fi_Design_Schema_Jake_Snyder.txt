## SUMMARY

The speaker discusses the progress and updates of the Open Intent project, a community-driven schema designed to facilitate the extraction and sharing of design data across different tools. The project aims to provide tool optionality, model-driven integration, and a programmatic interface for easier data handling and automation.

## IDEAS:

- Open Intent is a community-driven schema for representing design data.
- The project aims to solve the issue of extracting data from various design tools.
- It provides design tool optionality, allowing users to pick the right tool for the job.
- Open Intent is model-driven, with a defined model for data output from tools.
- It offers a programmatic interface, simplifying integration with other systems.
- The project started in March and pivoted from using Yang to Json schema based on feedback.
- Model version 1.0 has been released, indicating working models are available.
- Community involvement has been significant, with contributions from various members and vendors.
- The project hosted 33 community meetings in 2023, showing active engagement.
- A demo was presented using "hamina" to illustrate data manipulation and visualization.
- The speaker encourages RF tool and AP vendors to integrate with Open Intent.
- Open Intent supports third-party development for additional tool compatibility.
- The project is hosted under Google GitHub but is a personal passion project of the speaker.
- A challenge was issued to RF tool providers to support Open Intent by the end of the first half of the year.
- The speaker offers help to those interested in importing or exporting maps using Open Intent.
- Regular calls are held to support and engage with the community.

## QUOTES:

- "Open Intent is a Community Driven schema and the idea is all of us spend an enormous amount of time in design tools."
- "Getting that data out of those tools is not a great place."
- "Open Intent is basically a community defined schema here's how we represent our design data to get it out and into other systems."
- "It gives us design Tool optionality."
- "Model driven meaning that it we have a defined model of what the data that comes out of one of these tools should look like."
- "We did pivot to using Json schema."
- "We've had a tremendous amount of help from members of the community."
- "This is just something to get data out of our design tool."
- "This is a project that has been on my mind for you know like a decade."
- "We promise to support this by the end of uh end of second half."

## HABITS:

- Engaging with the community through regular meetings.
- Seeking feedback from experienced professionals before making technical decisions.
- Pivoting strategies based on community advice for better outcomes.
- Actively working on integrating third-party tools for broader compatibility.
- Offering support and guidance to new participants in the project.
- Hosting calls at different times to accommodate global participants.
- Encouraging vendor participation to enhance tool integration.
- Committing to continuous improvement and updates of the project.
- Sharing progress and challenges openly with the community.
- Focusing on practical solutions for real-world design tool issues.

## FACTS:

- Open Intent started in March after being announced a year prior.
- The project shifted from using Yang to Json schema based on feedback.
- Model version 1.0 has been successfully released.
- The community has actively contributed, with notable members mentioned.
- In 2023, 33 community meetings were hosted, showing significant engagement.
- Four RF tooling vendors and 15 non-vendor participants have been involved in meetings.
- The project aims for third-party support to increase tool compatibility.
- Open Intent is hosted under Google GitHub but is not affiliated with Google projects.
- A challenge was issued to RF tool providers to support Open Intent by mid-year.
