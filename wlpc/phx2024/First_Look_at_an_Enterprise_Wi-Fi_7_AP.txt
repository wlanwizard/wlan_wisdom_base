## SUMMARY

Jim, a Wi-Fi expert, presents an update on Wi-Fi 7, debunking misconceptions and sharing insights gained since his previous talks. He addresses the realities of Wi-Fi 7 features like extremely high throughput, punctured transmissions, and multi-link operation, correcting earlier statements and setting expectations based on practical experience and technical limitations.

## IDEAS:

- Wi-Fi 7's marketing has led to misconceptions about its capabilities.
- Initial assumptions about Wi-Fi technology often prove incorrect upon deeper investigation.
- The theoretical maximums of Wi-Fi 7 features like 4K QAM and 320 MHz channels are practically unattainable.
- Real-world application of Wi-Fi 7 features like punctured transmissions and multi-link operation (MLO) is more complex and limited than initially thought.
- The process of adopting new spectrum bands (like 6 GHz) is slow and varies by country.
- MLO's potential for full duplex communication in Wi-Fi is currently not feasible due to technical and regulatory limitations.
- The concept of using multiple APs simultaneously for a single device (multi-AP operation) was considered but is not included in the current Wi-Fi 7 standard.
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) calculations for Wi-Fi devices are often misunderstood, leading to incorrect assumptions about transmit power.
- The maximum transmit power allowed under PSD regulations is higher than many realize, but practical deployment often requires lower settings.
- Future research is needed to understand the impact of setting transmit power below the maximum allowed by PSD regulations.

## QUOTES:

- "I have made more mistakes and I've been more wrong than anybody in this room."
- "There is a lot of misconceptions, there is a lot of things that we don't know."
- "We're not going to get to 46, 48 bajillion gigabits per second, sorry it's just not going to happen."
- "Puncture transmission... it's a fixed definition, it's not something that it will do dynamically on the fly."
- "Multi-link operation... trying to get both of them firing up at the same time is going to be kind of difficult."
- "The process of getting [6 GHz spectrum] and doing it has been slow and painful."
- "Power Spectral Density allows us to focus on signal to noise."
- "If you start at 11, you can't go any higher."
- "We're going to go back into the labs and we're going to go test a bunch of this stuff."

## HABITS:

- Regularly revisiting and questioning initial assumptions about technology.
- Engaging with peers for feedback and correction on technical presentations.
- Continuously updating the community on new findings and corrected misconceptions.
- Conducting practical tests in lab environments to validate theoretical concepts.
- Collaborating with other experts to explore and understand complex technical issues.
- Adapting presentations based on new insights and learnings.
- Encouraging others to conduct their own tests and share findings with the community.
- Staying humble and open to being corrected by peers.
- Using humor and relatable examples to explain complex technical topics.

## FACTS:

- Wi-Fi 7 includes features like 4K QAM, 16 spatial streams, and 320 MHz wide channels theoretically.
- The practical application of many Wi-Fi 7 features is limited by technical and regulatory constraints.
- The adoption of new spectrum bands like 6 GHz is a slow process that varies significantly by country.
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) regulations allow for higher transmit powers in wider channel bandwidths to compensate for increased noise.
- The maximum transmit power under PSD regulations can reach up to 27 dBm for APs operating in 160 MHz channels in the 6 GHz band.
