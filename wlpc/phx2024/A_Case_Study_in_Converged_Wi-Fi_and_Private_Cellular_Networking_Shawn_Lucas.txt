## SUMMARY

The content discusses a presentation on the evolution and challenges of deploying private LTE networks, focusing on the journey from initial excitement about CBRS in 2015 to the practical realities and solutions for integrating LTE with existing network architectures. The speakers explore the reasons why adoption was slow and how new automation platforms are addressing these challenges to make private LTE a viable option for various use cases.

## IDEAS:

- The initial excitement about CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) in 2015 promised to solve many problems with Wi-Fi.
- By 2020, the reality of deploying products and seeing the benefits of CBRS had not met expectations.
- One major hurdle for adopting private LTE was the prevalence of 4G devices when the industry was moving towards 5G.
- The cost of deploying private LTE, especially with 5G technology, is significantly higher.
- Wi-Fi's effectiveness and ubiquity have made it difficult for private LTE to be considered a necessary investment.
- The concept of "good enough" technology being the enemy of great advancements applies to the slow adoption of private LTE.
- Specific use cases for private LTE include environments with challenging physical conditions, such as manufacturing plants with metal walls and concrete floors.
- The lack of device support and the high quality of existing Wi-Fi networks were significant barriers to private LTE adoption.
- The need for a converged network automation platform to simplify the deployment and management of private LTE alongside existing network infrastructures.
- The evolution of network management from manual configurations to automated platforms that integrate LTE, Wi-Fi, and wired networks.
- The importance of a neutral host system to facilitate the integration and management of diverse network types.
- The potential for private LTE to provide better control over network resources and application prioritization.

## QUOTES:

- "It's been 84 years since we started talking about more coverage."
- "Good enough is always the enemy of great."
- "We thought it was going to deploy just like Wi-Fi, man we were liars."
- "You made the Wi-Fi too damn good."
- "For the first time, the LTE stuff's viable."
- "This is a solution looking for a problem, now I see it."
- "We're going to have everybody on Wi-Fi or we're going to have everybody on a DAS system."
- "It really gives you the platform that automation platform to combine this."
- "It's all your fault, all fault you made the Wi-Fi too damn good."
- "We didn't know we were lying, we were just stupid."
