## SUMMARY

Jonathan Davis (JD) from Juniper Networks discusses the reliability and trustworthiness of Cloud Network Access Control (NAC) solutions compared to traditional on-premises NAC systems. He addresses concerns about system availability, integrity, and security, and suggests questions to consider when evaluating cloud-based NAC solutions.

## IDEAS:

- The excitement around Juniper's acquisition of a cloud NAC provider highlights the evolving landscape of network security.
- Skepticism exists around the trustworthiness of cloud NAC solutions.
- Traditional on-premises NAC systems are complex and fragile, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
- Cloud NAC solutions offer the promise of reduced complexity and increased resilience.
- The architecture of cloud NAC solutions, including microservices, can enhance their reliability and flexibility.
- Regular updates and mitigations are easier to implement in cloud-based systems without impacting service.
- Cloud NAC solutions can potentially eliminate the need for extensive downtime for updates.
- Questions about architecture, update frequency, and outage scheduling are crucial when evaluating cloud NAC providers.
- Security of data transmission (e.g., using RadSec for secure radius communication) is a key consideration.
- Integration with cloud-based directories and respect for data sovereignty are important features of cloud NAC solutions.
- The ability to independently verify and validate user and device experiences is a significant advantage.
- The transition from on-premises to cloud NAC solutions requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure security and reliability.
- The fragility of traditional NAC products poses risks to network security.
- High availability and geo-diversity are critical components of a robust cloud NAC solution.
- Direct connectivity to cloud-based directories can simplify infrastructure and reduce layers of complexity.
- Evaluating the user experience and ease of troubleshooting are essential when choosing a cloud NAC solution.

## QUOTES:

- "Can we really trust Cloud NAC?"
- "This is really more a discussion around what we do currently in NAC and how that changes in the cloud."
- "Can we trust that it's going to be available, accessible by our users when they need it, and is there integrity?"
- "We traditionally follow this map...and as we do that we increase complexity."
- "A basic misconfiguration doesn't break security that we spent all of that money to create."
- "Fragile was one of the words that was thrown out...when we talk about the product that's responsible for protecting our network."
- "Your failure domain for it also includes your WAN team, your hardware and software, their vendors, their software updates, and of course your service provider."
- "Radius is secure, right?...It is a stateless protocol and it runs across UDP relies on MD5 encryption and is vulnerable to both offline and replay attacks."
- "Can you trust your on-premises NAC solution? No."
- "What does the architecture look like?...Is it microservices based?"

## HABITS:

- Regularly evaluating the architecture and resilience of network security solutions.
- Asking critical questions about the frequency of updates and mitigations in cloud NAC solutions.
- Considering the impact of scheduled outages on network security and operations.
- Assessing the security of data transmission in network access control solutions.
- Integrating cloud-based directories with network security systems for simplicity and efficiency.
- Ensuring geo-diversity and data sovereignty compliance in cloud NAC solutions.
- Verifying and validating user experiences with network access control systems independently.
- Keeping abreast of potential vulnerabilities in traditional network security protocols like Radius.
- Continuously seeking improvements in network security through technology advancements like microservices.
- Prioritizing direct connectivity to cloud-based directories to reduce complexity in network access control.

## FACTS:

- Juniper Networks acquired a cloud NAC provider, sparking discussions about the trustworthiness of cloud NAC solutions.
- Traditional on-premises NAC systems involve complex infrastructures that can lead to fragility and security vulnerabilities.
- Cloud NAC solutions can offer high availability, resilience, and ease of updates compared to traditional systems.
- Microservices architecture in cloud NAC solutions allows for more flexible and reliable service delivery.
- Cloud-based systems can facilitate regular updates without requiring downtime or extensive change management processes.
- Security concerns with traditional Radius communication can be addressed with RadSec, which provides secure transmission over TLS/TCP.
- Direct integration with cloud-based directories can simplify network access control implementations.
- Geo-diverse deployment of cloud NAC solutions can help meet data sovereignty requirements and enhance reliability.
- The transition from on-premises to cloud-based NAC solutions involves evaluating various architectural and operational factors.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Evaluate the architecture of potential cloud NAC solutions, focusing on resilience and flexibility offered by microservices.
- Consider how often updates, features, and mitigations are added to the cloud NAC solution and how this impacts service availability.
- Assess the potential for scheduled outages by the vendor and how this aligns with your organization's change management processes.
- Ensure that the cloud NAC solution supports secure data transmission methods like RadSec to address vulnerabilities in traditional protocols.
- Look for cloud NAC solutions that offer direct connectivity to your cloud-based directory services to reduce complexity.
- Verify that the solution can handle geo-diversity and comply with data sovereignty laws such as GDPR where necessary.
- Independently validate user and device experiences with the cloud NAC solution to ensure it meets your security and usability requirements.
- Consider transitioning from on-premises to cloud-based NAC solutions to benefit from increased reliability, flexibility, and ease of management.
