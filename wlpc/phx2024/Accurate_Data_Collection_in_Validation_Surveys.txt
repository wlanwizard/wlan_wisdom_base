SUMMARY:
Mika Hakala, Founder and CEO of Cidos, presents insights from designing the Cidos Wave, a Wi-Fi survey device. He discusses the importance of hardware design, particularly antenna placement, and introduces an AI engine that can predict Wi-Fi coverage by generating digital building models from survey data.

IDEAS:
- Importance of hardware design in Wi-Fi survey devices.
- Antenna placement significantly affects the accuracy of Wi-Fi surveys.
- Human bodies can introduce errors in Wi-Fi signal measurements.
- The concept of an "error budget" to manage and minimize inaccuracies in Wi-Fi surveys.
- Utilizing AI to fill in gaps in Wi-Fi surveys, improving efficiency and accuracy.
- The potential for AI to generate digital building models from limited survey data.
- The trade-off between survey thoroughness and reliance on AI for data accuracy.
- The impact of environmental factors, like metal objects and human presence, on antenna performance.
- The benefits of designing Wi-Fi survey devices to be as omnidirectional as possible.
- The challenge of achieving accurate Wi-Fi measurements in real-world environments versus RF chambers.
- The role of generative AI in predicting outcomes for unsurveyed areas.
- How careful initial data capture allows for more error tolerance in later processing steps.
- The possibility of improving productivity in Wi-Fi surveying by using AI to reduce the need for extensive manual surveys.
- The importance of considering the physical interaction between the survey device and its user.
- How different carrying methods of the survey device can affect measurement accuracy.
- The potential for AI to adjust for multipath effects based on building materials and design.
- The significance of having a flexible tool that can adjust for accuracy needs versus quick assessments.
- The impact of walking more or adding more data points to mitigate measurement errors.
- The concept of trading off between manual survey effort and AI assistance based on project requirements.

QUOTES:
- "Antennas are a little different...signals coming from there will reflect from the heat sink...and kind of messes up the antenna pattern quite a bit."
- "We want to be you know good antenna pattern as Omni as it can be."
- "Sometimes when I rotate my body becomes go between the device and the AP."
- "We have this concept of error budget...all these step introduce error."
- "If you get Wi-Fi stuff within 3 DBS plus minus 3 DBS you're right on the money."
- "When did human body become RF transparent?"
- "We just figured that hey our customers are going to spend a lot of time walking and surveying let's give them as accurate results as we can."
- "If you have less measurement points you can have higher error."
- "This is no simulation...AI builds the model for me."
- "Ideally we think that your tool would allow you to trade off because sometimes you need more accuracy sometimes you just need a quick read and be gone."

HABITS:
- Focusing on getting key building blocks right in product design.
- Testing products extensively in both controlled (RF chamber) and real-world environments.
- Considering user interaction with the product during the design phase.
- Utilizing an error budget to manage and minimize inaccuracies throughout the design process.
- Leveraging AI to enhance product functionality and efficiency.
- Conducting experiments to validate design decisions and product features.
- Adapting product use to mitigate potential sources of error (e.g., changing how the device is carried).
- Continuously seeking ways to improve accuracy and efficiency in product usage.
- Engaging with the community and potential users for feedback and improvement suggestions.
- Prioritizing thoroughness in data collection when necessary, while also offering tools for quicker assessments.

FACTS:
- Mika Hakala has 15 years of experience designing wireless devices and software.
- Human bodies can introduce an error margin of about plus-minus 5 dB in Wi-Fi signal measurements.
- Cidos' AI engine can construct digital building models from survey information, predicting outcomes for unsurveyed areas.
- The AI engine's predictions introduce an error margin, but careful initial data capture allows for this additional processing step without compromising overall accuracy.
- A thorough manual Wi-Fi survey can be significantly more time-consuming than utilizing AI to fill in gaps.
