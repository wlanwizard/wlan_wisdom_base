## SUMMARY

Jason Hiner from Comcast business discusses the challenges and strategies involved in deploying thousands of Wi-Fi access points (APs) within a constrained 30-day period, drawing parallels to the "Brewster's Millions" story. He covers the planning, requirements, constraints, and execution phases necessary for such a large-scale Wi-Fi deployment in various environments like stadiums, schools, and retail chains.

## IDEAS:

- Deploying thousands of APs in 30 days is likened to a "Brewster's Millions" scenario, requiring careful planning and execution.
- The project involves working within tight time constraints and managing a large number of APs.
- Different environments like stadiums, schools, and retail chains present unique challenges for Wi-Fi deployment.
- A systems engineer's approach focuses on understanding both requirements and constraints.
- Typical requirements include coverage, usage, device types, network segmentation, application needs, high availability, and capacity.
- Constraints can include time, internal resources, cost, physical architecture of the building, and information accuracy from customers.
- Advanced planning is crucial, including predictive modeling, IP scheme development, and site surveys.
- Testing new technologies before deployment ensures network functionality.
- Pre-provisioning equipment can save valuable time during the installation window.
- Understanding the core infrastructure is essential for planning bandwidth and high availability setups.
- Existing infrastructure may need to be reused or upgraded to meet new demands.
- Designing the network involves considering device types, capacity, applications, and choosing appropriate technology like Wi-Fi 6 or 7.
- High bandwidth per user may require using larger channel widths to meet throughput demands.
- The deployment process includes surveying, provisioning, staging equipment, and installing APs within a tight schedule.
- Post-deployment optimization may involve tweaking channels, optimizing power settings, and utilizing AI tools for network adjustments.

## QUOTES:

- "You don't actually have to be crazy to deploy thousands of APs in 30 days but it helps."
- "Requirements are what you need to do; constraints are what you have to live with."
- "Every building and location on the network will have unique layouts."
- "More APs does not necessarily equal more capacity."
- "If you're promising over 100 Meg SLA per user guess what you're using 40 MHz or 80 MHz channels whether you want to or not."
- "It's not going to just work at the end of the 30 days."
- "If it can go wrong it will go wrong of course it's DNS right it's always DNS."
- "This is a concept that I've talked about before about Mass customization."
- "You may wind up going into an environment that has some really old infrastructure like CAT 5 or cat 3."
- "You're probably going to be going back in there and tweaking channels and optimizing power."

## HABITS:

- Planning deployments meticulously in advance to accommodate for both requirements and constraints.
- Performing predictive modeling to anticipate network needs and configurations.
- Developing IP schemes and conducting site surveys prior to actual deployment.
- Testing new technologies in a controlled environment before full-scale implementation.
- Pre-provisioning equipment to streamline the installation process.
- Aligning resources to match the installation window for efficient deployment.
- Utilizing AI tools for post-deployment network optimization.
- Reusing existing infrastructure when possible to save costs and time.
- Tweaking AP locations based on actual coverage needs rather than assumptions.
- Turning off unnecessary frequencies strategically to reduce interference.

## FACTS:
