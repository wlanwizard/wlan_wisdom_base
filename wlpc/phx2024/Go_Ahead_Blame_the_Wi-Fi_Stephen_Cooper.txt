## SUMMARY

Steven Cooper from the Juniper Miss team discusses the application of data science and automation in troubleshooting and improving Wi-Fi networks, beyond just signal strength and coverage. He explores various machine learning models and algorithms that can help network engineers diagnose and solve complex network issues more efficiently.

## IDEAS:

- Data science and automation can significantly enhance problem-solving in Wi-Fi networks.
- Often, Wi-Fi issues are attributed to factors beyond signal strength, such as DNS issues, VLAN configurations, or device-specific problems.
- Machine learning models can automate the detection of root causes in network issues, improving efficiency.
- Supervised learning techniques like K-nearest neighbors can predict user preferences based on past data.
- Unsupervised learning can cluster data to identify patterns or anomalies without predefined labels.
- Decision trees can help in diagnosing network issues by systematically narrowing down potential causes.
- Anomaly detection algorithms can monitor network performance and flag deviations from the norm, potentially identifying issues before they impact users.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality of data, making it easier to visualize and understand complex datasets.
- Leveraging machine learning for network troubleshooting can reduce manual labor and improve accuracy in identifying and resolving issues.
- The complexity of algorithms correlates with computational requirements; more complex models may provide better insights but require more resources.
- Automated tools can simulate user experiences on the network to validate configurations and performance before deployment.
- Data science tools can also help in non-networking contexts, such as customer segmentation or fraud detection.

## QUOTES:

- "Data science and automation can help solve some problems beyond the Wi-Fi access layer."
- "It's usually DNS isn't it?"
- "Machine learning and deep learning technology can automate and find those root cause problems."
- "The more complex these algorithms are, the more computational complexity that's behind there."
- "Anomaly detection is where we can have some models learning the normal baseline of the network."
- "We want to try and get on top of those quickly as possible so you can fix things before users are on site yelling and screaming."
- "You can use the network infrastructure to do that natively based on the same AI models."
- "Leveraging the same sort of data inputs into the same models that have been trained and learned in this over time."
- "We all know that framing errors are bad and we know that that's going to cause problems."
- "This is where the machines are doing that leg work for you."
