## SUMMARY

The presentation, titled "Rethink Your Uplink," focuses on the importance of considering uplink performance in Wi-Fi networks, especially with the advent of 6 GHz bands. The speaker delves into the technical aspects of uplink performance, challenges with indoor clients, and the implications for network design and client device behavior.

## IDEAS:

- The importance of considering uplink performance in Wi-Fi network design has often been overlooked.
- With the introduction of 6 GHz bands, there are new challenges and considerations for uplink performance.
- Indoor clients face specific challenges due to transmit power limitations and the characteristics of 6 GHz frequencies.
- The speaker introduced a new iPhone 15 Pro and Wi-Fi 6E network to illustrate real-world uplink performance.
- Management and control traffic in 6 GHz operates under different constraints compared to data traffic, affecting uplink performance.
- Client classification in the US for 6 GHz includes indoor clients, dual clients, and fixed clients, each with different transmit power capabilities.
- The speaker highlighted the significant difference in uplink RSSI between 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, indicating a need for adjusted network designs.
- Real-time applications like Teams and Zoom could face issues in areas with poor uplink performance in 6 GHz networks.
- Design tips for 6 GHz networks include modeling uplink coverage and considering more spatial streams on APs to improve receive sensitivity.
- The presentation suggests that current validation surveys may not adequately capture uplink performance, highlighting the need for new approaches.

## QUOTES:

- "because it Rhymes and I thought it would help me win votes"
- "for the most part we take that for granted"
- "the receive sensitivity of modern APS is ridiculous"
- "things are different in 6 GHz"
- "I just got an iPhone 15 Pro and I've got a Wi-Fi 60 Network at home"
- "screaming fast down link and the up Link's pretty good it's not great but um"
- "as I start to get further away from my APS um the Uplink degrades a little bit faster than the down link"
- "with RSSI minus 67 andus 65 the Uplink the transmit data rate from my phone had gone all the way down to mcs1"
- "the transmit power limitations are the most interesting thing here"
- "if you have trouble with hotspots causing CCI in 6 GHz it won't quite be as bad"

## HABITS:

- Regularly testing and analyzing network performance with new devices like the iPhone 15 Pro.
- Running shortcuts or scripts to monitor connectivity and performance metrics.
- Conducting site surveys and RF modeling to design Wi-Fi networks.
- Engaging in discussions with teams and communities to share findings and insights.
- Cycling in Phoenix as a form of networking and community engagement.
- Using specialized software tools for network design and analysis, such as H for uplink modeling.
- Taking real-world client devices to marginal signal areas for testing network performance.
- Sharing knowledge and experiences with the wider community through presentations and talks.
- Continuously learning about new technologies and standards in Wi-Fi networking.

## FACTS:

- The introduction of 6 GHz bands brings new challenges for uplink performance in Wi-Fi networks.
- Indoor clients have specific transmit power limitations that affect their performance in 6 GHz networks.
- The iPhone 15 Pro is among the devices that support Wi-Fi 6E, which operates in the 6 GHz band.
- Management and control traffic in 6 GHz is limited to using only 20 MHz channels, affecting transmit power.
- There are three classes of clients for 6 GHz in the US: indoor, dual, and fixed, each with different capabilities.
- Uplink RSSI is significantly lower on average in 6 GHz compared to 5 GHz by about 10 dBm.
- Real-time applications may face performance issues in areas with poor uplink performance in 6 GHz networks.
- More spatial streams on an AP can increase its receive sensitivity, improving performance for lower power signals.
- Validation surveys that do not account for uplink performance may not fully capture network performance issues.
- The speaker's analysis is based on real-world data from US customer bases regarding 6 GHz performance.
