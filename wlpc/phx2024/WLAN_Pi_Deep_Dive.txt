## SUMMARY

Nick Turner, a member of the W LMI team, presents an overview of the W LAMPI project, including its contributors, the different models of W LAMPI devices, their features, and the latest updates to the W LAMPI OS. He also discusses how to upgrade hardware, upcoming software and hardware features, and how to get involved or obtain a W LAMPI device.

## IDEAS:

- The W LAMPI project is a community-driven initiative focused on developing tools for Wi-Fi professionals.
- There are two main models of W LAMPI: the M4 and R4, each with distinct features like Power over Ethernet (PoE) and USB OTG.
- The project's software is a customized fork of Raspberry Pi OS, pre-loaded with tools for Wi-Fi professionals.
- W LAMPI devices can be used for practical applications like running speed tests or troubleshooting network issues on-site.
- The project encourages contributions from new members and values the community's input on development.
- Upgrading the Linux kernel to 6.7.1 in W LAMPI OS 3.2 resolved issues with Kismet crashes and enabled support for Wi-Fi 7 modules.
- The project provides detailed guides and cookbooks for users to perform various Wi-Fi related tasks.
- An A2E adapter board has been created to facilitate the use of Wi-Fi 7 modules in the W LAMPI M4 without modification.
- Upcoming software features include initiating SSID association from the web UI and building out APIs for data requests and actions.
- Future hardware developments aim to introduce OTG functionality to the M4 model, enhancing its versatility.
- The project maintains a presence on Slack for community interaction and support.
- Users can transform an existing Raspberry Pi 4 into a W LAMPI device by downloading the project's custom OS image.

## QUOTES:

- "The W LAMPI project is made up of a group of contributors... we've got Jerry, Josh, Adrien, Benona, and Jerry."
- "The units that we handed out at the Deep dive were Wi-Fi 6E but this board can take the Wi-Fi 7 modules asterisk with a little bit of manipulation."
- "The project itself started in 2016; it's Community Driven."
- "I wish I had a box that did X, aha I can use this."
- "We upgraded the Linux kernel to 6.7.1... this is how we have enabled the ax uh the be2 200 Wi-Fi 7 modules."
- "One of our Labs involves Kismet and we started launching Kismet and we had sporadic unit crashes across the board."
- "We are continuing to develop the W LAMPI software and user experience."
- "We are hoping to bring a model in the future of the W LAMPI M4 plus that'll be the unit that has OTG."
- "If you have a Raspberry Pi 4... you already have a W LAMPI."
- "Any questions about the availability of W LAMPI Hardware head out to the store or call me a little bit later today."

## HABITS:

- Weekly meetings with key contributors to discuss project progress and issues.
- Encouraging contributions from new members by highlighting their skills on project slides.
- Regularly updating the project's OS with new drivers and tools for Wi-Fi professionals.
- Documenting step-by-step guides for performing various functions with W LAMPI devices.
- Gradually transferring material from deep dive sessions into accessible cookbooks for users.
- Actively seeking feedback from users to improve software and hardware features.
- Utilizing Slack for community engagement and support.
- Offering detailed instructions for hardware upgrades and modifications.
- Experimenting with new designs and solutions to improve user experience, such as an improved joystick cap mechanism.
- Committing to regular software updates around major community events.
