## SUMMARY

Luke Jenkins from Weber State University discusses the implementation and expansion of eduroam (educational roaming) at the WPC 2024 conference. He explains how eduroam provides seamless Wi-Fi access for students and faculty across institutions and countries, and shares insights on a project to extend eduroam's reach through "eduroam to go."

## IDEAS:

- Eduroam is a service that allows students and faculty to access Wi-Fi seamlessly across educational institutions worldwide.
- The project aims to expand eduroam's reach to places like coffee shops, enhancing connectivity for students outside traditional academic settings.
- Utilizing older or cheaper access points (APs) loaded with open-source firmware can make the expansion of eduroam both feasible and cost-effective.
- The initiative involves technical configurations like tunneling traffic back to a central data center, ensuring secure and efficient connectivity.
- Eduroam's success at the conference, with 80 devices connecting from 32 different domains, demonstrates its utility and potential for broader application.
- The project encountered challenges, such as stability issues due to bandwidth limitations, but these were addressed and resolved.
- Collaboration with local education networks and leveraging community resources are key strategies for expanding eduroam's infrastructure.
- The use of open-source tools and software, like OpenWrt and WireGuard, is crucial for the project's technical implementation.
- Encouraging vendors to support eduroam by adding specific features to their products could further facilitate the service's expansion.
- The project underscores the importance of internet access as a critical resource for students, especially highlighted during the pandemic.

## QUOTES:

- "Eduroam is the um longstanding uh it's 20 plus years old I believe started in Europe way for educational students faculty to uh attend other institutions."
- "Fast free frictionless Wi-Fi that's what we always go for right Keith."
- "We had 80 devices connect which is pretty good for 375 attendees."
- "The idea was we would take old old APS um or older APS were cheap APS load up open wrt open wart."
- "We need to Tunnel the uh radius and the traffic back to our IP space."
- "Please meet your license obligations U there are certain vendors who are good about posting their GPL and lgpl code."
- "Consider unlocking your Hardware after the end of life."
- "Every K12 school in Utah has eduroam uh they generally use it for their take-home devices."
- "We wanted to help make that a little bit better uh so the idea was we would take old old APS."
- "No issues unique toed Jerome here at WL."

## HABITS:

- Collaborating with local education networks to expand Wi-Fi access.
- Utilizing open-source software for network infrastructure projects.
- Engaging with the community through talks and presentations to share project progress.
- Testing and troubleshooting network configurations in real-world settings.
- Leveraging older technology in innovative ways to provide modern solutions.

- Advocating for vendor support in enhancing product compatibility with educational projects.
- Committing to transparency and compliance with software licensing obligations.
- Continuously seeking ways to improve internet access for educational purposes.

## FACTS:

- Eduroam started over 20 years ago in Europe as a way for educational students and faculty to attend other institutions seamlessly.
- At the WPC 2024 conference, 80 devices connected to eduroam from 32 different domains, indicating its widespread use and acceptance.
- The project successfully expanded eduroam's reach by utilizing older or cheaper APs loaded with open-source firmware like OpenWrt.
- Eduroam was extended to non-traditional locations such as coffee shops, enhancing connectivity for students outside academic settings.
- Technical challenges such as bandwidth limitations and stability issues were encountered but resolved, demonstrating the project's adaptability.
- The initiative leverages community resources, including local education networks and open-source tools, for its implementation.
- Eduroam's expansion is part of a broader effort to ensure internet access is available as a critical resource for students, especially highlighted during the pandemic.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Consider expanding eduroam's reach to more non-traditional locations such as public libraries or parks.
- Explore partnerships with more vendors to enhance product support for eduroam-related projects.
- Engage more educational institutions in adopting eduroam, especially in regions with lower adoption rates.
- Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about eduroam and its benefits for students and faculty.
- Organize workshops or webinars to educate IT professionals in educational institutions on setting up and managing eduroam.
- Encourage the development of more open-source tools that can facilitate the expansion of eduroam or similar services.
- Advocate for policies that support greater internet access in educational settings, leveraging eduroam as a model.
- Explore funding opportunities or grants that can support the infrastructure costs associated with expanding eduroam.
- Develop a mentorship program where institutions experienced in implementing eduroam can guide others new to the process.
- Create a centralized repository of resources, best practices, and troubleshooting tips for institutions implementing eduroam.
