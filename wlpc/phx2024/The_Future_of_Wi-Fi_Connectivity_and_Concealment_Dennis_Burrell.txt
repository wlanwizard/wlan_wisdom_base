## SUMMARY

Dennis Burell discusses innovative ways to conceal Wi-Fi antennas in various environments, including floors, stores, outdoor malls, and even outer space scenarios. He emphasizes the importance of seamless integration without sacrificing signal strength, using examples like the Millennium Falcon and various real-world applications.

## IDEAS:

- Concealing antennas can enhance aesthetic appeal while maintaining functionality.
- The transition to Wi-Fi 6E necessitates innovative solutions for antenna placement.
- Embedding antennas in raised access flooring offers a bottom-up coverage approach.
- Directional antennas can be hidden in plain sight within stores, optimizing RF coverage.
- Creative concealment methods include embedding antennas in light poles and junction boxes.
- The design of concealment solutions can be tailored to specific environments, such as outdoor malls or university campuses.
- Antennas can be integrated into everyday objects like bollards and LED lights without being noticeable.
- The effectiveness of concealed antennas can be measured through heat maps and signal strength tests.
- Mobile wireless cases offer a portable and TSA-compatible solution for temporary setups.
- Concealment techniques can even extend to imaginative scenarios like the Millennium Falcon, demonstrating the versatility of these solutions.
- The principle of hiding antennas "whenever and wherever" showcases the potential for widespread application across different settings.
- The playful reference to Dr. Seuss's "Green Eggs and Ham" adds a lighthearted touch to the presentation, emphasizing creativity and openness to new ideas.

## QUOTES:

- "We're going to do a Wi-Fi Journey with Dr. Seuss."
- "You can hide antennas in the floor."
- "With Wi-Fi 6E coming out and not being able to use external antennas."
- "This is what we call our friendly floor tile."
- "Transmitting and receiving through the concrete."
- "You can actually fine-tune your cone of coverage of RF coverage."
- "These pictures were taken at the University of Kentucky."
- "You can hide antennas in outer space."
- "The Millennium Falcon... has antennas camouflaged all around."
- "In conclusion, you can hide antennas in the floor, in a store, in lights, out of sight, in a case, in outer space."
