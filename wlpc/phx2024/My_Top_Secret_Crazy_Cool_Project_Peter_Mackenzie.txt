## SUMMARY

The speaker discusses their project of mounting an access point on a drone for warehouse surveys, detailing the challenges, solutions, and the process of creating a YouTube video to document the journey. The project aimed to innovate in the field of wireless networking within large warehouse environments.

## IDEAS:

- Mounting an access point on a drone can significantly simplify warehouse surveys.
- Traditional methods of conducting warehouse surveys, like using tripods or cherry pickers, are cumbersome and pose safety risks.
- Drones offer a novel solution to reach high ceilings in warehouses for network testing.
- The project faced numerous challenges, including weight management, power supply, and drone control.
- Utilizing drones indoors requires careful planning due to the absence of GPS signals.
- The project was not just about proving the feasibility of using drones for network surveys but also about engaging with a younger audience through YouTube.
- The speaker's motivation included bridging the gap between traditional networking professionals and the younger generation who consume content differently.
- The project showcases the potential for technology to solve practical problems in innovative ways.
- Engaging with the community and seeking sponsorship were crucial steps in realizing the project.
- The project highlights the importance of adapting to new platforms and mediums to reach and educate different audiences.

## QUOTES:

- "Mounting an access point on a drone has been a bit of an adventure."
- "Getting Cherry Pickers and you have to hire a cherry picker, you have to go up in the cherry picker... it's a lot of hassle."
- "Why not place the access point on a drone and fly it up to the height do your survey."
- "The challenge was how do you fly that and hover it above a warehouse aisle."
- "It shows it is actually possible to place an access point on a drone for warehouse surveys."
- "I was trying to prove a concept not give you a full solution."
- "If you're doing Warehouse service every single day, I think it is quite easy to get an ROI on this project."
- "Twitter, that's for old people."
- "They don't watch TV; they watch YouTube."
- "I need a big crazy project; what shall I do? I know, I'll take an AP and put it on a drone."
- "It's expensive making these videos so you do need help from vendors."

## HABITS:

- Seeking innovative solutions to traditional problems.
- Engaging with younger team members to understand their perspectives and preferences.
- Adapting communication strategies to reach different audiences (e.g., using YouTube).

## FACTS:

- Traditional warehouse surveys require tripods that can reach up to 15 meters high, which are bulky and pose safety risks.
- Drones can offer a more flexible and safer alternative for conducting high-ceiling surveys.
- The project utilized a Juniper 45e access point connected to an Acelex Tri-Band antenna.
- The weight of the equipment posed significant challenges for drone flight stability.
- Indoor drone flights are challenging due to the lack of GPS signals, requiring experienced piloting skills.
- The speaker's team consists of young engineers who prefer YouTube over traditional media like TV or Twitter.
- The project was sponsored by Juniper Networks, highlighting the importance of industry support in experimental projects.
- The use of drones for practical applications within industries like retail is still in its exploratory phase.
- Safety regulations and permissions are significant hurdles when flying drones indoors for commercial purposes.
- The project aimed not only to solve a technical problem but also to engage with a younger audience through modern platforms.
