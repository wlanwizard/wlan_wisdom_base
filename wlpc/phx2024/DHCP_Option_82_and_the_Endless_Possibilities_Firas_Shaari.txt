QUOTES:
- "DHCP option 82 is what we call the DCP relay agent information."
- "The DHCP relay agent... intercepts the packet, inserts some information in it, and then sends it to the GV server."
- "We allow two three well three pieces of type of information to be sent under either one of those."
- "In open Wi-Fi, we use something called entral protocol that protocol is used to configure the AP for configuration and management."
- "We're using the match F uh statement and the filtering substring basically substring function look um on a bite level."
- "It's trying to actually send it to the AP which is the relay agent so that's an internal IP address that backet we not going to go anywhere."
- "We need to introduce an IP table rule um at the output chain to actually you know direct anything that goes to Port 67."
- "I'm flying through this uh so because I'm out of time and uh this is what I imagine you guys looks like right now after hearing gcp so many times."
