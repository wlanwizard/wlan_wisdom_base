## FACTS:

- Cat 5e cables are capable of transmitting 2.5 gigabits per second up to 100 meters.
- Temperature variations can significantly impact cable performance.
- Thin patch cords can reduce the effective length of a network link due to resistance imbalance.
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) requires careful consideration of resistance balance to prevent data loss.
- Improper strain relief can cause significant issues in network performance.
- Existing cables may still meet network requirements with proper testing, potentially avoiding replacement costs.
- Cat 6 cables typically have a center spline, affecting their flexibility compared to Cat 5e cables.
- Wire mappers alone are insufficient for comprehensive cable testing.
- It's possible to transmit data through unconventional materials like bananas under certain conditions.
- The industry often relies on assumptions ("should work") rather than definitive testing.
