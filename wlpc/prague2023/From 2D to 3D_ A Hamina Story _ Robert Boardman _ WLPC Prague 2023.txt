QUOTES:
- "Why do things in 3D? One, it's going to help you design; two, you're going to be able to validate better."
- "We don't design in 2D; we design in 3D."
- "I'm a big fan of not doing things... oh, the live demo fails; I want to do it in real life."
- "You're not selling Wi-Fi; you're selling your design; you're selling yourself."
- "Have you ever tried to explain hallway attenuation on a 2D map?"
- "We design, we validate, we sell."
- "Using simple things like an API key, I'm able to actually pull this back and validate these things."
- "Wouldn't you rather go to your boss and say, 'Hey, this conference room right here is really in trouble'?"
- "When you're designing now, using 3D makes things easier."
- "Thank you to H for building a tool that makes my day-to-day life better."
