## SUMMARY

The presentation discusses the advancements in Wi-Fi technology, specifically focusing on the Enhanced High Throughput (EHT) or Wi-Fi 7 data rates. It covers the increase in data rates, new channel widths, modulation techniques, and the introduction of multiple resource units (MRUs), providing insights into how these changes impact wireless communication.

## IDEAS:

- The transition from Wi-Fi 6 to Wi-Fi 7 (EHT) has led to a significant increase in data rates, with the total number of data rates jumping from around 2,000 to 10,800.
- New channel widths, such as the 320 MHz channels, allow for more tones/subcarriers, enabling higher data transmission rates.
- The introduction of MRUs allows for more flexible channel utilization, potentially improving efficiency in data transmission.
- Advanced modulation techniques, like the 4K QAM, pack more bits into each transmission, further boosting data rates.
- Spatial streams have been expanded up to 16 in Wi-Fi 7, offering potential for even greater throughput.
- The MCS table has been updated to accommodate these changes, adding complexity but also providing a clearer picture of potential data rates.
- The use of frequency diversity through DCM (Dual Carrier Modulation) aims to increase the resilience of wireless transmission at the cost of lower data rates.
- The implementation of new MCS indexes and modulation techniques is designed to extend the range and reliability of Wi-Fi connections, particularly beneficial for IoT devices.
- Real-world testing of Wi-Fi 7 devices has shown impressive data rates, validating theoretical improvements.
- The presentation suggests that while not all new features of Wi-Fi 7 will be immediately utilized, the advancements are significant and lay the groundwork for future wireless communication improvements.

## QUOTES:

- "we ended up with like 2,000 something data rates the new number with EHT is 10,800."
- "if we have more tones we can just send more data it's pretty much a straight forward here."
- "the multiple resource units so if we go back to H and we look at a 20 MHz wi Channel."
- "with the new modulation so that what what does impact how does it impact the the data rates."
- "the spatial streams too briefly up to 16."
- "it's adding two new indexes right index 12 and 13 uh corresponds to the 4K quam modulation."
- "the idea behind this as as far as understood it is it's more for like um a single AP deployment."
- "you know resilienc in the communication so as a result we're losing in terms of data rates."
- "I just read the standard for this so yeah um they have a couple of limitations."
- "he pretty much got the maximum he could get on a 320 MHz wide channel."
