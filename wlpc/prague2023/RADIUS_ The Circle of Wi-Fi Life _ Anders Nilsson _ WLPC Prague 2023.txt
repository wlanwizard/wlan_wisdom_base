## SUMMARY

The speaker discusses the evolution of RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service), its initial purpose for managing modem pools, and its current applications such as VPN authentication. They highlight the limitations of RADIUS, including its reliance on outdated security protocols like MD5, and introduce the development of RADIUS 1.1 (renamed to RADIUS ALPN) which aims to address these issues by supporting both TLS and DTLS, among other improvements.

## IDEAS:

- RADIUS was initially designed for managing modem pools.
- It has evolved to support a wider range of applications, including VPN authentication.
- The original RADIUS protocol relied on outdated security measures like MD5.
- There's a push towards modernizing RADIUS to address its current limitations.
- RADIUS 1.1, or RADIUS ALPN, is an effort to update the protocol with better security and functionality.
- The new version aims to support both TLS (TCP based) and DTLS (UDP based) for improved security.
- The introduction of a 32bit extended ID support in RADIUS ALPN could solve the issue of session limitations in large networks.
- The academic community plays a significant role in the development and standardization of network protocols like RADIUS.
- The speaker mentions the importance of community feedback and collaboration in improving network protocols.
- There's an emphasis on the need for protocols to evolve alongside technological advancements to ensure security and efficiency.

## QUOTES:

- "RADIUS, the one we know, the one we love, it's been around for ages."
- "In the beginning, RADIUS was actually something that you did just for managing your modem pools."
- "RADIUS is getting old."
- "RADIUS is dumps the fire; it's relying on MD5; you don't have any privacy stuff like that."
- "Today we're using RADIUS for many more things than just having your local wireless controller here."
- "RADIUS is UDP based."
- "We made it possible to do eduroam at airports in Sweden."
- "The whole authentication is gone and then things go bad."
- "RADIUS started in 1991."
- "We were one of the initiators of the IETF RADIX group."
