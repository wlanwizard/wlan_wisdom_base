## SUMMARY

Nick Turner and J discuss the W lampi, a custom Raspberry Pi device designed for Wi-Fi scanning and analysis. They cover its features, use cases, and how it can be used for remote Wi-Fi monitoring, spectrum analysis, and data collection.

## IDEAS:

- The W lampi is a Raspberry Pi running a custom OS for Wi-Fi scanning and analysis.
- It can scan 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks, which many laptops cannot do.
- Users can access the W lampi remotely, making it useful for scanning networks from anywhere in the world.
- The device supports both pre-assembled units and DIY kits for customization.
- Online resources and user guides are available to help users learn how to use the W lampi.
- Cookbooks provide step-by-step guides for performing various tasks with the W lampi.
- The development of the W lampi is community-driven, with an open invitation for contributions.
- The device supports external Wi-Fi adapters for enhanced functionality.
- It originally started as an iPerf tester but has evolved to offer a richer feature set.
- The core team of the W lampi project is open to new members without requiring a long-term commitment.
- Visualization tools are being developed to better represent data collected by the W lampi.
- The device can be used as a remote sensor, particularly useful in scenarios requiring PoE (Power over Ethernet).
- The W lampi supports scanning to file, allowing users to capture detailed Wi-Fi network information for later analysis.
- Spectrum analysis dashboards are available through Grafana integration, providing insights into Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi interference.
- The device's web UI offers access to various tools and applications for Wi-Fi analysis and monitoring.
- The W lampi project encourages community contributions, including sharing custom dashboards and tools.

## QUOTES:

- "I use my W lampi to scan 6 GHz Wi-Fi my laptop can't do that yet."
- "The development of the W lampi is a platform we want more tools like this is for everybody."
- "The cookbooks come from WLPC Deep dive lab sides."
- "We're also developing this is also work in progress the concept of cookbooks."
- "The beauty is we now have two models available now they share the same OS."
- "We have a brand new website as well so feel free to visit the website."
- "The project start really it happened here at WLPC."
- "You can buy things online from Badger Wi-Fi and get involved."
- "It's a platform it's for everyone make of it what you will."
- "The W lampi is quite elegant way to do it uh you can quite discretely do your Wi-Fi scan."

## HABITS:

- Regularly using the W lampi for scanning 6 GHz networks not accessible by standard laptops.
- Contributing to the development of the W lampi by sharing ideas and tools with the community.
- Accessing and referring to online resources and user guides to learn about the W lampi's capabilities.
- Utilizing cookbooks for step-by-step guidance on performing specific tasks with the W lampi.
- Engaging with the community through weekly calls and Slack channels for advice and collaboration.
- Monitoring remote sites or events using the W lampi's remote sensor capabilities.
- Performing detailed Wi-Fi network analysis by scanning to file and analyzing data with external tools.
- Using Grafana dashboards for visualizing Wi-Fi and spectrum data collected by the W lampi.
- Customizing the W lampi with external adapters and displays based on specific needs or projects.
- Encouraging new members to join the core team without requiring a long-term commitment.

## FACTS:

- The W lampi is based on a Raspberry Pi running a custom OS forked from Raspberry Pi OS.
- It was initially developed as an iPerf tester but has evolved to include a wider range of features.
- The device supports both pre-assembled units and DIY kits, allowing users to build their own customized version.
- Online resources, including a user guide and cookbooks, are available to assist users in learning how to use the W lampi.
- The development of the W lampi is community-driven, with an open invitation for contributions from anyone interested.
- External Wi-Fi adapters are supported by the W lampi, enhancing its scanning capabilities beyond what is built-in.
- Visualization tools are being developed to help represent data collected by the W lampi in more insightful ways.
- The device can function as a remote sensor, especially useful in scenarios requiring Power over Ethernet (PoE).
- Grafana integration provides dashboards for spectrum analysis, allowing users to visualize Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi interference.
- The project encourages community contributions, including sharing custom dashboards and tools developed for the W lampi.
