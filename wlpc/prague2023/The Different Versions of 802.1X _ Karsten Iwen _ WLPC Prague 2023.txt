QUOTES:
- "Different versions of 802.1X are implemented based on specific needs."
- "Everything that is not understood is ignored, and the version could even change within one session."
- "The standard uses a capital X, and a capital X is not more expensive than a small x."
- "A vendor implements one version based on the needs he has for specific functionality."
- "The biggest change was the addition of MACSec and Mech security agreement in Wireless."
- "We have one technology for Wired and one technology for wireless."
- "The RC4 key descriptor type is defined as deprecated."
- "With these amendments, we can also use AES 256 and we have larger packet numbers."
- "The product version was not increased; it stays at version three."
- "The RC4 key descriptor type is not mentioned anymore; it's gone."

HABITS:
- Regularly updating knowledge on network security standards.
- Implementing the most current version of security protocols based on system requirements.
- Prioritizing backward compatibility in network design to ensure seamless communication.
- Focusing on clear documentation and explanations when adopting new security features.
- Keeping abreast of deprecated features and removing them from network configurations.
