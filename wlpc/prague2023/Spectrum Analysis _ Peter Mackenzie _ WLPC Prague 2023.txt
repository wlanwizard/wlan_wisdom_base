## SUMMARY

Torson from Aronia presents their work on designing and producing spectrum analyzers, including the software. They demonstrate the capabilities of their spectrum analyzers in identifying and analyzing various frequencies, harmonics, and the impact of interference on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.

## IDEAS:

- Spectrum analyzers are crucial for identifying and analyzing various frequencies and their behaviors.
- Harmonics can indicate a poorly built transmitter, affecting multiple frequencies.
- Identifying occupied channels can help in avoiding interference in wireless communications.
- The ability to visualize the entire spectrum, including harmonics, provides a deeper understanding of signal quality and interference.
- Real-time analysis of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals can reveal the impact of interference on these networks.
- The demonstration shows how different devices, like cameras, can create harmonics that interfere with Wi-Fi signals.
- The importance of bandwidth in analyzing signals is highlighted, with wider bandwidths allowing for more detailed analysis.
- The tool can decode Wi-Fi data in real-time, capturing every packet sent over the air.
- Recording spectral data over long periods can help identify intermittent problems that occur at specific times.
- The software includes a simulation tool for teaching and explaining modulation.
- The spectrum analyzer can be used for troubleshooting jamming and other interference issues.
- The device is capable of analyzing up to 110 GHz, with different versions available for various needs and budgets.
- The presentation emphasizes the importance of offline storage for security and privacy reasons.
- The ability to decode frames and measure transmission times offers insights into network performance.
- Visualizing data transfers and Bluetooth activity alongside Wi-Fi signals helps in understanding the overall wireless environment.

## QUOTES:

- "This transmitter is not well built let's say it that way uh because it has a lot of multiple frequencies."
- "We often just focus on 2.45 gig so what happens when we turn on a narrow Bend signal generator is really interesting."
- "You really get a mess but but can you see what's happening in 4.8 I thought that's really interesting isn't it we're not just affecting one frequency we're affecting the entire frequency band."
- "Even in 6 gig you will get problems with that because of the harmonics."
- "I've never seen the high monics in 5 gig from a 2.4k camera so that's pretty cool."
- "The fastest in the world I really believe that and it's true."
- "Forget it they don't get it sorry for that."
- "This is just a fun project for the community let's say that way usually made for the ham radio guys."
- "WI-Fi is even more interesting so so there you go I can a a less than cost Spectrum analyzer."
- "You can go up to 110 GHz if you like but then of course it's not cheap anymore no."
