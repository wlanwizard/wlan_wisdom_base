## SUMMARY

John Ma, a system engineer for Rus in France, presents on the evolution of Wi-Fi beacons, detailing their historical significance, technical evolution, and practical applications in modern Wi-Fi networks.

## IDEAS:

- Beacons originally served as navigational aids with fire and light signals.
- The evolution of beacons from simple fire lights to complex Wi-Fi signals.
- Wi-Fi beacons are sent by APs to clients to inform about network availability and services.
- Beacons help keep the network synchronized by sending signals at regular intervals.
- The comparison of Wi-Fi beacon frequency to natural rhythms in animals.
- The structure of Wi-Fi beacons includes mandatory and optional information elements.
- The growth of information elements in Wi-Fi standards from 7 in 1999 to 73 today.
- The introduction of country information elements and ERP information for device support indication.
- The role of vendor-specific information elements in preserving the structure of Wi-Fi frames.
- The importance of airtime optimization in Wi-Fi design to prevent performance degradation.
- The use of multiple base IDs and extension IDs to differentiate information elements.
- The introduction of new features like the FI indication in 2020 to improve Wi-Fi functionality.
- The challenge of reaching the maximum number of information elements and the solution through extension IDs.
- The potential for beacons to communicate not just with machines but also with people through specific ID naming.
- The significance of airtime optimization techniques in the era of 6 GHz Wi-Fi.
- The use of beacons for troubleshooting and network analysis without accessing management interfaces.
- The impact of legacy devices on network performance and how beacons can reveal their presence.
- The role of preferred scanning channels in six GHz Wi-Fi to speed up discovery and reduce interference.

## QUOTES:

- "Beacons used to be used by navigational things with signal fires and lighthouses a very long time ago."
- "Wi-Fi I guess everybody here is aware that Beacons are sent by APs to clients."
- "We got around 585 beacons per minute, so it's like a heartbeat of the Wi-Fi."
- "Bon doesn't expect any reply; they just here to inform, provide information, and that's it."
- "From 1999 to 2020, Wi-Fi evolved a lot; we got tons of new features, new services."
- "The number of Wi-Fi beacons must remain under control per AP space."
- "By just hearing these beacons, airplanes and boats know where they are."
- "The frame body itself is divided into two parts: non-AI information and information elements."
- "In 2016, we already reached the maximum number of information elements."
- "With six GHz, we're entering into a new world requiring new rules and some adjustments."
