## SUMMARY

The presentation at the Wireless LAN Professionals Conference (WLPC) introduced a new Wi-Fi survey method called "Just Go" by the speakers. This method simplifies the survey process by eliminating the need for a floor plan, scale setting, or manual location tracking, utilizing an iOS device's LiDAR scanner to automatically generate a floor plan and collect Wi-Fi data as the user walks around.

## IDEAS:

- The "Just Go" survey method simplifies Wi-Fi surveys by not requiring a floor plan or manual scale setting.
- It utilizes the LiDAR scanner in iOS devices to automatically generate floor plans.
- Users simply walk around with their device connected to a psychic 2 or psychic, and the app does the rest.
- This method collects Wi-Fi signals across 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz frequency bands.
- It's designed to be fast and requires minimal interaction from the user, making it less prone to human error.
- The accuracy of the "Just Go" method is highlighted as one of its best features.
- It's particularly useful in situations where floor plans are not available or are incomplete.
- The method is seen as a way to quickly collect data for analysis without needing detailed pre-survey preparations.
- It's also mentioned as being fun and almost meditative due to its simplicity and ease of use.
- Other survey methods like stop-and-go, continuous, and autopilot are also available but require more user interaction.
- The presentation introduces another feature, packet capture on the Sidekick 2, allowing capture on four channels simultaneously.
- Packet capture is useful for troubleshooting Wi-Fi issues and is now available for users with an active license.
- An evening party hosted by eahal is announced, offering free food, drinks, and a giveaway of a psychic 2.

## QUOTES:

- "You just simply connect your iOS device to your psychic 2 or psychic and you just walk around."
- "It doesn't require you to have a floor plan doesn't require you to set the scale."
- "It collects all of the Wi-Fi signals across 2.4, 5, and six GHz frequency bands."
- "The accuracy of that thing is the best because you can't do it wrong."
- "This is going to be amazing I'm doing a warehouse survey they've been able to provide us two two of the floor plans but one floor plan they just completely lost."
- "It's like the meditation you just walk around you don't have to think about accuracy."
- "You don't have to scan everything behind every door you just walk around in the same way as if you had walked while doing continuous survey."
- "With a pocket capture on the Sidekick 2, you can guys capture on four channels at the same time which is mind-bending."
- "No hidden agenda no marketing no sales just a good time."
- "It's really cool to see but hands up in the room if you've ever been in this scenario before where you've gone to go and do a Wi-Fi survey onsite and you've not been provided the floor plans."
