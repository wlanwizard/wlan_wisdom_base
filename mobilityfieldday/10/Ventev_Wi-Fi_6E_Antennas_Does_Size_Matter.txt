## SUMMARY

The presentation covers the evolution and design of WiFi antennas, focusing on the transition from larger to smaller form factors while maintaining performance, and introduces the latest Ado patch antenna. The speaker, a veteran in mobile field day presentations, discusses the technical aspects, challenges, and considerations in designing antennas for different WiFi standards, including WiFi 6E.

## IDEAS:

- The evolution of antenna design from larger to smaller form factors without compromising signal quality.
- Introduction of the Ado patch antenna, a compact yet powerful solution for WiFi 6E.
- The importance of antenna size in relation to its performance and application in various environments.
- Challenges in designing antennas that support multiple frequency bands while maintaining a small form factor.
- The role of iterative design and testing in achieving optimal antenna performance.
- Considerations for ensuring compatibility with existing and future WiFi standards.
- The impact of antenna design on network aesthetics, coverage, and capacity.
- Trade-offs involved in miniaturizing antenna designs, such as the front-to-back ratio.
- The potential for future antenna designs to incorporate even smaller form factors, as hinted by the mention of a "zepto" patch antenna.
- Exploration of new materials and configurations to reduce antenna size while ensuring performance across different frequency bands.

## QUOTES:

- "So I'm pretty much a veteran, an old head, as we would say."
- "Last mobile Mobility field day I actually spoke about a new design for WiFi 6E APS."
- "Does size matter if you take a look at this slide right here?"
- "We wanted to undergo what we call a small form factor line of products."
- "Our latest antenna that we are currently shipping is our FTO patch antenna which is 3.4 by 3.4 inches."
- "The question is, does size matter?"
- "We tested different dual-band dual radiators to find one that would allow it to be closely nested to other radiators."
- "We're trying to get the package as small as possible while still maintaining good isolation return loss."
- "The tradeoff is that as you condense or make the antenna smaller, there's certain things that you're going to sacrifice."
- "This is a great antenna for aesthetics play, for coverage versus capacity."
