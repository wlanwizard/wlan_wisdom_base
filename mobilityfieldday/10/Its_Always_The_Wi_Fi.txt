## SUMMARY

- The shift towards subscriptions is driven by vendor interests rather than customer needs, creating a dependency that's hard to escape.
- Some see subscription models as a way to ensure continuous innovation and improvement.
- Others view them as a financial strategy that benefits shareholders at the expense of customer value.
