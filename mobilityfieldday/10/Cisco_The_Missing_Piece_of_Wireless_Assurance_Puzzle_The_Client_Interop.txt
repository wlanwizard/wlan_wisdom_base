## SUMMARY

Amim, a product manager at Cisco AI Ops Wiress site, discusses the overlooked aspects of network management and the benefits of AI Ops for operational excellence and end-user experience improvement. He emphasizes the importance of understanding client devices and the role of AI in enhancing Wi-Fi reliability and security.

## IDEAS:

- The primary goal of AI Ops is to enhance end-user experience with better Wi-Fi: faster, reliable, and secure.
- Traditional network troubleshooting has heavily relied on assumptions due to a lack of direct communication protocols for wireless devices.
- The industry has not developed a standard protocol like LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) for wireless, leading to reliance on indirect data collection and assumptions.
- There's a significant gap in understanding between client devices and network infrastructure, which AI Ops aims to bridge.
- The vast number of Wi-Fi devices globally (22 billion) poses a challenge for network vendors to maintain operational excellence due to the diversity and scale of devices.
- A historical approach to network management involved direct hardware and software integration between client and infrastructure vendors, but this has not scaled well with the growth of the Wi-Fi industry.
- Cisco's partnership model aims to improve mutual understanding between network infrastructure and client devices by sharing detailed device profiles and failure reasons.
- The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 has been a turning point for device readiness, with most modern devices now supporting advanced Wi-Fi features without requiring user intervention.
- The adoption of advanced Wi-Fi standards like 11k, 11r, and 11v is still low, indicating a gap in leveraging these technologies for better network performance.
- Client analytics provide a foundation for true network troubleshooting by offering insights into both sides of the network-client interaction.
- The evolution of the Wi-Fi industry requires a return to foundational principles of interoperability and mutual understanding, as demonstrated by the success of the CCX program.

## QUOTES:

- "What we are looking for from AI Ops is how to improve the end user experience."
- "The industry never came up with the idea of LLDP for wireless."
- "We have to do a lot of assumption here and that's been the industry norm from the day of Wi-Fi."
- "22 billion Wi-Fi devices in their life cycle... everyone in the world they at least has to have three Wi-Fi devices."
- "75% of Wi-Fi problems came from client but how much we know about the client?"
- "Knowing the client information is a starting point of client Assurance."
- "Without installing any software agent... those days are gone."
- "The first slide that I talked about 22 billion, the Wi-Fi industry grew up outgrow too much too fast."
- "Let's go back to basic and let's have all the key player in the industry who have the biggest market share."
- "Client analytic is really the starting point to do true troubleshooting and true visibility."

## HABITS:

- Emphasizing the importance of understanding both sides of the network-client interaction for effective troubleshooting.
- Regularly updating device profiles to ensure compatibility with new network standards.
- Leveraging partnerships with other vendors to share insights and improve interoperability.
- Focusing on end-user experience as the primary goal of network management and optimization.
- Adopting a data-driven approach to network management, using analytics to inform decisions.
- Prioritizing security and reliability in network operations to build trust with end-users.
- Encouraging the adoption of advanced Wi-Fi standards through education and support.
- Continuously seeking feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement.
- Collaborating across industry stakeholders to develop and adopt universal protocols for wireless communication.
- Staying informed about the latest developments in Wi-Fi technology and standards.

## FACTS:

- There are 22 billion Wi-Fi devices globally, which is five times the number of IPv4 addresses available.
- The global population is 8 billion, suggesting an average of at least three Wi-Fi devices per person.
- 75% of Wi-Fi problems originate from client devices, yet there's limited understanding of these devices by network vendors.
- The adoption rate of advanced Wi-Fi standards like 11k, 11r, and 11v is still low despite their availability.
- Cisco has 8 million Wi-Fi networks in the cloud, but only 1.45% of users benefit from 11l, a standard that has been around for over 15 years.
- The CCX program was one of the most successful interoperability programs before Wi-Fi became a defacto standard in enterprise segments.
- The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 broke many legacy systems due to compatibility issues.
- iPhone users are significantly adopting Wi-Fi 6, indicating readiness for newer Wi-Fi technologies.
- Cisco's client analytics aim to provide deep insights into device behavior without requiring additional software on client devices.
- The partnership model between Cisco and other vendors aims to enhance mutual understanding and interoperability.
