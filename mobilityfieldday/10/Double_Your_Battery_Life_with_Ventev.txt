## SUMMARY

John Hess, a product manager for Ventive, presents on enhancing battery life by integrating lithium batteries into UPS systems. He discusses the benefits of lithium-ion phosphate chemistry for doubling system life, operational efficiency, and the availability of retrofit kits for existing units.

## IDEAS:

- Lithium batteries can double the life of UPS systems.
- Integration with IoT and compatibility with various enclosures enhance system flexibility.
- Lithium-ion phosphate chemistry offers significant improvements over lead-acid batteries.
- Operational and life span benefits are key selling points for lithium battery systems.
- Stainless steel, polycarbonate, and aluminum enclosures provide robust protection for the systems.
- Thermostat-controlled environments ensure optimal operating temperatures.
- The shift to lithium batteries addresses the need for longer backup times and durability in harsh environments.
- Retrofit kits allow for easy upgrades from lead-acid to lithium batteries.
- The transition to lithium is part of an extension of the product line, not a replacement of lead-acid batteries.
- Production in the United States emphasizes local manufacturing capabilities.
- Partnerships with major companies like Cisco and Aruba highlight industry collaboration.
- The move towards lithium batteries is driven by customer demand for lower operational costs and longer field life.
- Lithium batteries offer up to 10 years or 2,000 cycles of life, significantly outperforming lead-acid batteries.
- Retrofit kits are designed for easy installation, promoting system upgrades.
- The presentation aims to address community and municipal needs for reliable power in extending Wi-Fi and security services.
